Enforcing time constraints:

Upon inserting a new row connecting student with section, it would be
helpful to check for overlap of existing enrolled courses by:
 1. convert the currently enrolled classes into a ruby-object form.
 2. check the time of each currently enrolled class
 3. if any of the times of the enrolled classes overlaps with the course
    send an error saying that the student cannot sign up for the course
 4. otherwise, allow the new course to be added to the schedule, and the row
    to be added to the section_student association

Cross-listing classes:

Create an intermediate "true_classes" table that will:
  1. have a one to many relationship with class to maintain all cross listings
  2. have a one to many relationship with sections to monitor the same sections
      regardless of cross listing
